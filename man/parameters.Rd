\title{Control parameters for whale strike simulation}
\usage{
parameters(ms, Ss, impactWidth = 3, impactHeight = 1.5, lw, mw, Sw,
  delta = 0.01, Eskin = 2e+07, theta = 45, beta = 0.3, Ebeta = 6e+05,
  alpha = 0.5, Ealpha = 4e+05, Cs = 0.005, Cw = 0.003)
}
\arguments{
\item{ms}{Ship mass [kg].}

\item{Ss}{Ship wetted area [m^2]. This, together with \code{Cs}, is used by
used by \code{\link{shipWaterForce}} to estimate ship drag force.}

\item{impactWidth}{Ship impact horizontal extent [m]; defaults to 2m if not specified.}

\item{impactHeight}{Ship impact vertical extent [m]; defaults to 1.5m if not specified.}

\item{lw}{Whale length [m]. If not supplied, \code{\link{whaleLengthFromMass}} is used
to calculate this, given \code{lm}, but if neither \code{mw} nor \code{ml} is provided,
an error is reported. The length is used by \code{\link{whaleAreaFromLength}} to
calculate area, which is needed for the water drag calculation done by
\code{\link{whaleWaterForce}}.}

\item{mw}{Whale mass [kg]. If length is known, this could be estimated with
\code{\link{whaleMassFromLength}}.}

\item{Sw}{Whale surface area [m^2]. If length is known, this could be estimated with
\code{\link{whaleAreaFromLength}}.}

\item{delta}{Whale skin thickness [m]. Defaults to 0.01 m, if not supplied.}

\item{Eskin}{Whale skin elastic modulus [Pa]. If not provided, defaults to 20e6 Pa,
a rounded value of the 19.56+-4.03MPa estimate for seal skin, provided in Table 3
of Grear et al. (2017).}

\item{theta}{Whale skin deformation angle [deg]; defaults to 45deg if not supplied.}

\item{beta}{Whale blubber thickness [m]; defaults to 0.3m if not supplied.}

\item{Ebeta}{Elastic modulus of blubber [Pa]; defaults to 6e5 Pa (the value
suggested Raymond (2007 fig 37), rounded to 1 digit), if not supplied.}

\item{alpha}{Thickness of interior region [m]. This defaults to 1m, an
estimate of the radius of soft tissue below the blubber. For bone,
a value in the centimeter range might be reasonable.}

\item{Ealpha}{Elastic modulus of interior region [Pa]; defaults to 4e5 Pa,
rounded from the soft-tissue value 425294 Pa stated by Raymond (2007) page 36.
For bone, the value 9e8 Pa might be reasonable (see Raymond 2007
Table 2.3, which lists the elastic modulus of cortical bone as 854.2 MPa).}

\item{Cs}{Drag coefficient for ship [dimensionless],
used by \code{\link{shipWaterForce}} to estimate ship drag force. Defaults
to 5e-3, which is two times the frictional coefficient of 2.5e-3
inferred from Figure 4 of Manen and van Oossanen (1988), assuming
a Reynolds number of 5e7, computed from speed 5m/s, lengthscale 10m
and viscosity 1e-6 m^2/s. (The factor of 2 is under the assumption
that frictional drag is about half of total drag.)
The drag force is computed with \code{\link{shipWaterForce}}.}

\item{Cw}{Drag coefficient for whale [dimensionless],
used by \code{\link{whaleWaterForce}} to estimate whale drag force.
Defaults to 3.0e-3, for Reynolds number 2e7, computed from speed
2 m/s, lengthscale 5m (between radius and length) and
viscosity 1e-6 m^2/s.  The drag force is computed with
\code{\link{whaleWaterForce}}.}
