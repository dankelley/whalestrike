\title{Plot a strike object}
\usage{
\method{plot}{strike}(x, which = "all", center = FALSE,
  drawCriteria = TRUE, drawEvents = TRUE, debug = 0, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An object inheriting from class \code{strike}}

\item{which}{A character vector that indicates what to plot.
This choices for its entries are:\itemize{

\item \code{"location"} for a time-series plot of boat location \code{xw} in black,
whale location \code{x} in blue, and skin location in dashed blue.

\item \code{"whale acceleration"} for a time-series plot of whale acceleration,
with horizontal lines drawn at 433 and 721 m/s^2,
which are estimates of the 10% and 50% probability of concussion
for the National Football League concussoin data presented in
Figure 9 of Ng et al. 2017.

\item \code{"blubber thickness"} for a time-series plot of blubber thickness,
with a red line drawn at 2/3 of the
initial thickness, based on the Grear et al. 2018 result (page 144, left column)
that mean (seal) blubber strength is 0.8MPa, whereas mean (seal) blubber
modulus is 1.2MPa, for a ratio of 2/3.

\item \code{"whale water force"} for a time-series plot of the water force on the whale.

\item \code{"blubber force"} for a time-series plot of the normal force resulting from blubber compression.

\item \code{"blubber stress"} for a time-series plot of the normal stress on the blubber.

\item \code{"skin force"} for a time-series plot of the normal force resulting from skin tension.

\item \code{"skin stress"} for a time-series plot of the skin stress in the along-skin y and z directions.
A red horizontal line is drawn at 19.56MPa, if that value is on-scale. This is a suggestion
of the maximum stress that the skin can accommodate without damage, inferred from an
entry in Table 3 of Grear et al. (2018) for the strength of seal skin.

\item \code{"values"} for a listing of \code{param} values.

\item \code{"all"} for all of the above.
}}

\item{center}{Logical, indicating whether to center time-series plots.
on the time when the vessel and whale and in closest proximity.}

\item{drawCriteria}{Logical, indicating whether to draw coloured horizontal lines
on some panels, suggesting critical values (see \dQuote{Details}).}

\item{drawEvents}{Logical, indicating whether to draw lines for some events,
such as the moment of closest approach.}

\item{debug}{Integer indicating debugging level, 0 for quiet operation and higher values
for more verbose monitoring of progress through the function.}

\item{...}{Other arguments (ignored).}
