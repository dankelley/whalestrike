\title{Whale side-view shape}
\description{
This is a data frame containing 45 points specifying the shape
of a right whale, viewed from the side. It was created
by digitizing the whale shape (ignoring fins) that is
provided in the necropsy reports of Daoust et al. (2018). The
data frame contains \code{x} and \code{y}, which are distances
nondimensionalized by the range in \code{x}; that is, \code{x}
ranges from 0 to 1. The point at the front of the whale is
designated as x=y=0.

\examples{
library(whalestrike)
data(whaleshape)
plot(whaleshape$x, whaleshape$y, asp = 1, type = "l")
polygon(whaleshape$x, whaleshape$y, col = "lightgray")
lw <- 13.7
Rmax <- 0.5 * lw * diff(range(whaleshape$y))
mtext(sprintf("Max. radius \%.2fm for \%.1fm-long whale", Rmax, lw), side = 3)
