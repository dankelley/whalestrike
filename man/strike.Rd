\title{Simulate the collision of a ship and a whale}
\usage{
strike(t, state, parms, debug = 0)
}
\arguments{
\item{t}{a suggested vector of times (s) at which the simulated state will be reported.
This is only a suggestion, however, because \code{strike} is set up to detect high
accelerations caused by bone compression, and may set a finer reporting interval,
if such accelerations are detected. The detection is based on thickness of
compressed blubber and sublayer; if either gets below 1 percent
of the initial(uncompressed) value, then
a trial time grid is computed, with 20 points during the timescale for
bone compression, calculated as
\eqn{0.5*sqrt(Ly*Lz*a[4]*b[4]/(l[4]*mw)}, with terms as discussed in
the documentation for \code{\link[=parameters]{parameters()}}. If this trial grid is finer
than the grid in the \code{t} parameter, then the simulation is redone
using the new grid. Note that this means that the output will
be finer, so code should not rely on the output time grid being
the same as that supplied in the \code{t} argument.}

\item{state}{A list or named vector holding the initial state of the model:
ship position \code{xs} (m),
ship speed \code{vs} (m/s),
whale position \code{xw} (m),
and whale speed \code{vw} (m/s).}

\item{parms}{A named list holding model parameters, created by
\code{\link{parameters}}.}

\item{debug}{Integer indicating debugging level, 0 for quiet operation and
higher values for more verbose monitoring of progress through the function.}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{"strike"}, consisting of a
list containing vectors for time (\code{t} (s)), ship position (\code{xs} (m)),
boat speed (\code{vs} (m/s)), whale position (\code{xw} (m)), whale speed (\code{vw} (m/s)),
boat acceleration (\code{dvsdt} (m/s^2)), and whale acceleration (\code{dvwdt} (m/s^2)),
a list containing the model parameters (\code{parms}), a list with the results of
the skin force calculation (\code{SWF}), a list with the results of the compression
force calculations (\code{WCF}), and a vector of whale water force (\code{WWF}).
}
\description{
Newtonian mechanics are used, taking the ship as undeformable,
and the whale as being cushioned by a skin layer and a blubber layer.
The forces are calculated by
\code{\link[=shipWaterForce]{shipWaterForce()}},
\code{\link[=whaleSkinForce]{whaleSkinForce()}},
\code{\link[=whaleCompressionForce]{whaleCompressionForce()}}, and
\code{\link[=whaleWaterForce]{whaleWaterForce()}}.
