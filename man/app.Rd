\title{GUI app for interactive whale-strike simulations}
\usage{
app(mode = "simple", options = list(height = 500))
}
\arguments{
\item{mode}{character value specifying the style to use.  Only
the value \code{"simple"} is permitted at present. This yields a
3-panel plot, constructed by \code{\link{plot.strike}},
called with default arguments.}

\item{options}{list containing options that are provided
to \code{\link[shiny]{shinyApp}}, which creates the GUI app.}
}
\description{
The \code{app()} function starts a GUI application that makes it easy to
run simple simulations and see the results in graphical form. Sliders
and buttons permit a fair degree of customization.  The application
has some build-in documentation, which supplements what can be found
in the \sQuote{Details} section of the present documentation.
}
\details{
When \code{app()} is run, a window will appear within a few moments. At the top of that
is a textual introduction to the system, with a button to hide that information. Below is
a user-interaction area, with buttons and sliders that control the simulation
and the plotted output. Below that is a plotting area, the contents of which
depend on the configuration of the simulation as well as the user's selection
of items to display.

The default setup, which is shown before the user alters any of the sliders,
etc., is a simulation of a small fishing boat, of mass 45 tonnes, moving at
speed 10 knots towards a whale of length 13.7m. (The whale length is used to
compute its mass, using a formula that is described by the output of typing
\code{help("whaleMassFromLength","whalestrike")} in an R console).

Sliders are provided for setting certain key properties of the ship and the
whale, with italic labels for those properties that are deemed most likely to
be adjusted during simulations.  The details of these and the other parameters
are revealed by typing \code{help("parameters","whalestrike")} and
\code{help("strike","whalestrike")} in an R console.

To the right of the sliders is a column of checkboxes that control the plotted
output. At startup, three of these boxes are ticked, yielding a display with
three panels showing the time history of the simulation
(\code{help("plot.strike","whalestrike")} provides details of the plots):
\itemize{
\item The left-hand plot panel shows whale and boat location, the former with an
indication of the interfaces between skin, blubber, sublayer, and bone.
\item The middle panel shows the same information as the left one, but with a
whale-centred coordinate system, and with labels for the components. This
makes it easier to see the degree to which the layers are compressed during the
impact.
\item The right panel is an indication of the estimated threat to the four layers
of the whale, with curves that are filled with grey for time intervals when
the impact stress (force/area) is less than the strength of the material in the
layer, and black for times when that threshold is exceeded.
}

Much can be learned by adjusting the sliders and examining the plotted output.
As an exercise, try setting to a particular ship mass of interest, and then to
slide the ship speed to higher and lower values, whilst monitoring the "threat"
panel for black regions. This will reveal a critical speed for conditions that
threaten the whale.  Next, try altering the sublayer thickness, which is a
surrogate for location along the whale body, because e.g. the sublayer is
thinner near the mandible.

Advanced users are likely to want to alter the values of impact width and
height. The default setting are intended to mimic a small fishing boat, such as
a Cape Islander. Try lowering the width, to simulate a strike by a daggerboard
or keel of a sailing boat.

Note that the pulldown menu for setting the whale species affects \emph{only} whale
mass. It does not affect the thicknesses of blubber or sublayer, the values of
which have been set up to represent a midsection strike on a North Atlantic
Right Whale.
